# k_nearest_neighbors

Examination of the k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm.

## Description
There are two notebooks:
1. Finding optimal k on iris-dataset. [Jupyter-Notebook](iris.ipynb)
2. Comparing Neuronal network with k-nearest neigbors and use PCA for dimensionality reduction in diabetes dataset [Jupyter-Notebook](diabetes.ipynb)

On the second task (diabetes dataset) it is found, that PCA (principle components analysis helps reducing computational effort and leads to comparable results.

Additonally it is found, that a neuronal network may perform slightly better, but effort for training and hyperparameter tuning is vastly higher.
